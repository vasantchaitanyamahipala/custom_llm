Deck Framing Installation Best Practices

Step 1: Planning and Layout
- Determine joist spacing (16" O.C. typical)
- Plan for proper drainage (1/4" per foot slope)
- Account for ventilation requirements

Step 2: Material Preparation
- Allow lumber to acclimate
- Sort material for best pieces
- Pre-cut to required lengths

Step 3: Installation Process
1. Install ledger board
   - Use proper flashing
   - Install with lag screws
   - Maintain proper spacing

2. Set support posts
   - Minimum depth requirements
   - Use proper concrete footings
   - Ensure plumb installation

3. Install beams and joists
   - Use proper hangers
   - Maintain level installation
   - Install blocking as required
